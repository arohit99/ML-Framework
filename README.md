# ML Framework

This project aims to build and deploy a machine learning app adhering to the best practises in the industry. The UI is build using streamlit, scikit-learn for machine learning, mlflow for tracking, matplotlib for plots, github actions to containerise the application and deploy to heroku. The app can be viewed [here](https://mlappframework.herokuapp.com). 

Data scientists today frequently use notebook based environments to run experiments. While this facilitates rapid development, these are not efficient in production environment. This project builds upon concepts like OOPS, clean code, code modularisation (modules and packages), logging, config setting etc. The key steps in the development approach were:

* create an virtual environment and install dependencies using requirements.txt
* explore data, run experiments using jupyter notebooks. However notebooks will not be used as part of final application package
* create params.yml to pass parameters
* create logs_config.yml to set up logging
* config.py reads values from params/ logs_config and initilizes variables
* custom_preprocess.py will handle data cleaning and data transformations. The functions will be specific to the input dataset and will return stardadised datasets ready for plotting, ML
* components.py contains core logic for data exploration and machine learning
* pages.py builds streamlit views
* app.py is the main module that connects all modules. It also takes care of logging/ mlflow tracking.
* While python scipts creates the application, we have few other components such as- dockerfile to build container image that packages all code and its dependencies into a single deployable unit, herokudeployment.yml triggers a github action to build and push docker image to heroku platform

## Set up process

To build docker image and run streamlit app locally, clone the repository and run following commands from project root directory. Open `http://localhost:8501/` to access the webapp

```bash
$ docker build -t app:latest .
$ docker run -it -p 8501:8501 --name MLApp app:latest
```

To manually push the docker image to heroku, run the following command. Access the heroku app at `https://mlappframework.herokuapp.com`


```bash
$ heroku login
$ heroku container:login
$ heroku create mlappframework
$ heroku container:push -a mlappframework web
$ heroku container:release -a mlappframework web
$ heroku open
```

## Limitations

Ideally, we would like to seperate out data cleaning, model development and serving activities. We would want to maintain a docker image specific to model serving atleast. To help with demonstration, I chose to have all code in one docker image.
